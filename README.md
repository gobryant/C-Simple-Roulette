This is a simple Roulette code I made when first learning C++

Contains the following
  1. A Color Bet (Red, Black, or Green)
  2. A Bank to keep track of winnings (Starts at $10,000)
  3. A bet placement
  5. A seed-based random number roll with a corresponding color
  6. A win = double the money bet, A loss = lose the money bet
  7. Repeats indefinitely, or until all money is lost
